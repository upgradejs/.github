## Our Commitment to Open Source

We maintain, co-maintain, and contribute to OSS because we love writing software
and sharing it. It's part of our [core values](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/values/our-values.html)
to be "open by default."

To elaborate a bit, we use a lot of open source tools everyday and we truly
believe we should give back to the community.

Writing software is time consuming and we as developers get paid to write it.
Considering so many developers took their time to write things we use every day
and apps we rely on for our daily jobs, it's only fair that we share our
knowledge ([in our blog!](https://www.upgradeJS.com/blog)) and the tools we made
ourselves with everyone else, so that others that have the same problems can
benefit from our expertise and contributions.

Also, it's a way to learn and to help others learn what they need to be
successful at their jobs.

Finally, and going back to the first sentence: we love to write software and we
love sharing it with everyone.
